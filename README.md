# Sprankle's Portfolio
A portfolio theme built on Jekyll and Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta, designed to leverage media-focused content with a separate section for a blog and static pages using [Jekyll Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and heavy use of [Bootstrap's new Card components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/).

# Dependencies
*Note that these steps are for Windows environments. MacOS/Unix environments may need to install RubyGems...just [follow this Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and you should be good to go.*
1) [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
2) Bundler (`gem install bundler` from command line once Ruby is installed)

# Installation & Usage
Fork it! After installing dependencies, use command line to navigate to root folder and enter `bundle install`. Then, use [Jekyll's built-in fuctions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) like `jekyll serve`  and modify to your heart's content.

Once complete, run `jekyll build` for deploying into the _site directory, which is what you should upload to a web server.

# To-Do
* Change HTML templates to Bootstrap-compatible builders
* WebPack functionality
* Actual portfolio work done via forking
