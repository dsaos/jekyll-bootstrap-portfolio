# Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta Portfolio
A portfolio theme built on Jekyll and Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta, designed to leverage media-focused content with a separate section for a blog and static pages using [Jekyll Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and heavy use of [Bootstrap's new Card components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/).

## Dependencies
1) [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
2) Bundler (`gem install bundler` from command line once Ruby is installed)

*For more details, you can check out the [GitHub Pages guide](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).*

## Installation & Usage
Clone/fork, and after installing dependencies, use command line to navigate to root folder and enter `bundle install`. Then, use [Jekyll's built-in fuctions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) like `jekyll serve`  and modify to your heart's content.

Once complete, run `jekyll build` for deploying into the `_site` directory, which is what you should upload to a web server.
